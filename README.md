# About-me
Information about me.
- Hi! I'm **@EstevaoAZ**, a *20 year old Computer Science student from Brazil;*
- I look for working remotely for a foreign company;
- I speak two languages: Portuguese (my mother tongue) and English (fluent, learned it by myself);
- I am very creative and passionate about IT stuff, I've been in love with it since I was a little kid :);
- I like heavy metal and some jazz and classical music;
- I'm a die-hard Lord Of The Rings fan;
- I'm in college, my course is called "an√°lise e desenvolvimento de sistemas", which kinda translates to "software engineering", but it's just normal Computer Science (I'll become a software engineer anyways);
- I'm currently learning and studying React JS, but I'm also improving my technical skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and GIT . I look forward to becoming a front-end developer;
- That's it! Thanks for visiting my profile and feel free to contact me! Have a nice day!
